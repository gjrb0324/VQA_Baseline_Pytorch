#Strong baseline for viusal question answering

This is a re-implementation of Vahid Kazemi and Ali Elqursh's paper [Show, Ask, Attend, and Answer: A Strong Baseline For Visual Question Answering in Pytorch](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03162) based on [Cyanogenoid's code](http://github.com/Cyanogenoid/pytorch-vqa).

Since Cyanogenoid focused on upgrading model's performance, I rebuilt model.py based on the paper.
